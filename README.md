Welcome to the **Instagram Clone** Python web application.

<hr>

## Description

**Instagram Clone** is a Python-based web application that emulates the popular social media web application "Instagram" by Meta. Just as the original application, Instagram Clone allows users to sign up and login before commencing with other activities. Users can then post their favourite pictures within the application, comment on other people's pictures and also like them. Users also have their own dedicated profile page where they can view their profile information and also the pictures that they have posted. The users get to perform these activities on a user-friendly interface similar to the original.

**Instagram Clone** is a web application which can be accessed by a device of choice with internet capabilities. No setup is required since it is in the form of a website. The application is built to be responsive across all devices with different media queries such as desktops, tablets and mobile phones.
